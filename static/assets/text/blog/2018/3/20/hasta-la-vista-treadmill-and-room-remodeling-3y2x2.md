If you have been to my house sometime in the past 4-5 or so years, you would know that I have a treadmill in my office, and I despise it. My office is my main room, and after 6 months of having the treadmill, I viewed it as a waste of space. Without it, so many configuration options would be available with my room.

At the beginning of 2018, my mom said something that I fully supported; she finally said that it was time for the treadmill to go. After 4 years of wishing for my treadmill to disappear, I finally had a supporter for my cause. After some conversation with my dad, he finally agreed to give me the 28 square feet that the treadmill occupied back to me.

Plans were made, and after 3 long months, we finally found a buyer for the treadmill. The date was set: March 20th, at 5:45 pm.

After about an hour or so of mechanics working, the treadmill was moved out of my room and the buyer set off with his new old treadmill. Now the only thing remaining was to put my renovations into action.

First we took all the stuff off of my desk so it would be easier to move. We then moved the desk itself out of the way so we could slide the couch towards the wall with the door. Then, we moved the desk into its new position near the red wall. Next, we thoroughly wiped off the desk's glass and began to replace the items on it. Finally, we wired the computer up again and made the finishing touches.

I truly enjoy how my room turned out after this remodel. Now, I feel that it is a place that I can truly be proud of.
