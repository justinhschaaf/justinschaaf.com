June 1, 2016, the date school ended for my year of 6th grade. Oh how I am excited to get some much needed time to rest and recover from the school year. Though the end of the school year is a happy time, I am also kind of sad because all of my teachers were very nice and the school year seemed too short. I am looking forward to summer, though I am not looking forward to the hundred-degree temperature!
