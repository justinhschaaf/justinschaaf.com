[colors.justinschaaf.com](https://colors.justinschaaf.com) is a container for a wide range of color palettes used in my various projects or that just look nice. It also includes a swatch generator to make your own color palettes using the same math that goes into the builtin colors.

## How does it work?

The website pulls all of the colors from a [JSON file stored on a static website](https://content.justinschaaf.com/common/config/colors.json) and generates the pages and swatches as the file specifies. It was developed using Angular and NPM.

> [!TIP]
> You can share a color from the color swatch generator with the link `https://colors.justinschaaf.com/g/{COLOR}`, with `{COLOR}` being replaced with the color you want to share (e.g. [`https://colors.justinschaaf.com/g/446688`](https://colors.justinschaaf.com/g/446688)).
