## What does it do?

When any entity takes damage from falling in the void, they get teleported upwards, effectively making them fall forever... or at least until they die of void damage.

## Why did you make it?

I was hosting a skyblock server for my friends and wanted to make it more interesting than falling into the void and immediately losing everything.
