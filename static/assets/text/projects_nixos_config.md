I've used Linux as a daily driver since August 2022. I started with the Budgie desktop environment on Solus and Fedora respectively, but this is where I want to take my systems next.

Instead of using a desktop environment, I plan on using Hyprland, a tiling window manager for Wayland, along with fine tuning exactly what software, fonts, and services I want to run at any given point. All of this is built atop NixOS, making the setup stable and easy to replicate.

> [!NOTE]
> NixOS is a Linux distribution centered around the Nix package manager. The system's applications and settings are defined in a config file, and changes are only applied when the system is rebuilt based off the current config. Each build of your system is saved--allowing you to easily revert destructive changes--and the config can easily be ported to other systems, making system setup a breeze.

## Where can I find it?
